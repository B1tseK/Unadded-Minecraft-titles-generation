# Unadded-Minecraft-titles-generation
how to use unadded Minecraft titles generation textures in Minecraft titles generation: <br>
#1 normal textures <br>
just download the textures of the desired font type and place them in the "files" when you select the texture for the font in the generator. <br>
#2 fan-made textures <br>
the fan-made texts do not run in the generator, if they worked, then there was no "fan-made" postscript, but you can make them for MTG so that the textures become active.
