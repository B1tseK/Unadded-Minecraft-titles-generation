# Unadded-Minecraft-titles-generation
how to use unadded Minecraft titles generation textures in Minecraft titles generation:
#1 normal textures 
just download the textures of the desired font type and place them in the "files" when you select the texture for the font in the generator.
#2 special/fan made textures
to use mob heads to generate, use these characters "Aabhkorux08"
the fan-made texts do not run in the generator, if they worked, then there was no "fan-made" postscript, but you can make them for MTG so that the textures become active.
